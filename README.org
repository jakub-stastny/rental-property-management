This is the front-end for the [[https://github.com/jakub-stastny/rpm.meta][rental property management system]].

/If you wonder where is the source code, it's not in the source control â€“ not directly anyway. Since I'm using literate programming, all the source code is organised in [[./chapters][chapters]]. There is a chapter about [[./chapters/literate-programming.org][literate programming]], explaining how to export source code out of the chapters./

* What now?
