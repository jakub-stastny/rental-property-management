[[https://github.com/jakub-stastny/rpm.frontend/actions/workflows/test.yml][https://github.com/jakub-stastny/rpm.frontend/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg]]

This is the front-end for the [[https://github.com/jakub-stastny/rpm.meta][rental property management system]].

If you wonder where is the source code, it's not in the source code â€“ not directly anyway. Since I'm using literate programming, all the source code is in the [[./chapters][chapters]]. There is a chapter about [[./chapters/literate-programming.org][literate programming]], explaining how to export the source code out of the chapters.

* Next steps

- If you're new to Clojure(Script) and you're using Emacs, you might like [[https://github.com/jakub-stastny/rpm.backend/blob/master/.env/README.org#writing-clojure-apps-in-emacs][writing Clojure programs in Emacs]] chapter in the backend repo.
- If you're new to ClojureScript, I made a [[doc/clojurescript-cheatsheet.org][ClojureScript cheatsheet]].
- Read the [[./src/app/main.org][main chapter]].
- I kept the [[./doc/cljs-app.md][cljs-app generator README]] around as a reference.
