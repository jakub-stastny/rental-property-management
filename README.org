This is the front-end for the [[https://github.com/jakub-stastny/rpm.meta][rental property management system]].

This branch is the *generated code* though. It is generated from the [[https://github.com/jakub-stastny/rpm.frontend/tree/literate][literate branch]].

If you're not used to literate programming, this (the =generated-code=) branch might be easier to wrap your head around, but there is a good reason for literate programming: especially the documentation. So you will not get the full idea about the project from the generated code only.

If you prefer, start reading the literate version [[https://github.com/jakub-stastny/rpm.frontend/blob/literate/chapters][here]].
