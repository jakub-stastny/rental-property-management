** Publishing

Tangle to a different file and load it from emacs.el

=org-publish-project=

Do we want a script to wrap this? We have to rename README.html to index.html.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle ../.env/elisp/publish.el :results silent
  (require 'ox-publish)

  (setq org-publish-project-alist `(
    ("rpm.frontend"
      :components ("rpm.frontend/documentation" "rpm.frontend/static"))

    ("rpm.frontend/documentation"
      :base-directory "~/rpm.frontend"
      :base-extension "org"
      :publishing-directory "~/rpm.frontend/exports/documentation"
      :recursive t
      :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html
      :headline-levels 4
      :auto-preamble t)

    ("rpm.frontend/static"
      :base-directory "~/rpm.frontend"
      :base-extension "css\\|js\\|png\\|jpg\\|gif\\|pdf\\"
      :publishing-directory "~/rpm.frontend/exports/documentation"
      :recursive t
      :publishing-function org-publish-attachment)))
#+END_SRC

** CSS

#+BEGIN_SRC css :tangle ../styles.css
  * {
    font-family: Helvetica;
