#+SETUPFILE: ../setupfile.org

* Installation

In Emacs press =C-c C-c= to evaluate each code block in this section.

** Emacs packages

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results silent
  (dolist (package '(clojure-mode cider))
    (unless (package-installed-p package)
      (message "~ Installing %s." package)
      (package-install package)))
#+END_SRC

* Configuration

In Emacs press =C-c C-v t= to tangle all the code blocks in this file.

** Emacs per-project configuration

We want to keep environment-specific configuration out of our =~/.emacs=.

https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/index.html CLJS not supported directly

The publish file is defined in [[./publishing.org][publishing.org]]. I don't like this dependency though. Maybe it'd be best to autoload any file in .env/elisp/autoload, that way we don't have this coupling.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle ../.env/emacs.el
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/.zsh/environments/elisp"))
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/rpm.frontend/.env/elisp"))

  (load "literate-programming")

  (add-to-list 'org-src-lang-modes '("clojurescript" . "clojurescript-mode"))
  (add-to-list 'org-src-lang-modes '("edn" . "clojure-mode"))
  (add-to-list 'org-src-lang-modes '("babashka" . "clojure-mode"))

  (load "publish")
